Suppose there are the symbols M, I, and U which can be combined to produce strings of symbols. 
Given the following transformation rules, could you transform the string "MI" to "MU"?

1. Add a U to the end of any string ending in I (e.g. MI to MIU)
2. Double the string after the M (e.g. MIU to MIUIU)
3. Replace any III with a U	(e.g. MUIIIU to MUUU)
4. Remove any UU (e.g. MUUU to MU)
