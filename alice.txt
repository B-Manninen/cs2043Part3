When Alice entered the Forest of Forgetfulness, she did not forget 
*everything*; only certain things. She often forgot her name, and 
the one thing she was most likely to forget was the day of the week. 
Now, the Lion and the Unicorn were frequent visitors to the forst. 
These two are strange creatures. The Lion lies on Mondays, Tuesdays, 
and Wednesdays and tells the truth on the other days of the week. 
The Unicorn, on the other hand, lies on Thursdays, Fridays, and 
Saturdays, but tells the truth on the other days of the week.

One day Alice met the Lion and the Unicorn resting under a tree. 
They made the following statements: 

Lion / Yesterday was one of my lying days. 
Unicorn / Yesterday was one of my lying days too. 

From these two statements, Alice (who was a very bright girl) 
was able to deduce the day of the week. What day was it?
